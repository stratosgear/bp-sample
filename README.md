# Sample Usecase

This is one of the simplest possible Reproducability in Science usecases.

In the current implementation the `reproducable.yaml` file is not used at all,
since we do not have the tool ready yet.

But the `dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files are properly working.

Running `docker-compose` in this folder should properly run the code and
generate output code in the `.\output` folder.
